Exercise 05
==============

Contains the code and writeups for Exercise 5, Lasso.

These are in two directories: `code` and `tex`

### tex

Contains the tex sources and pdfs for the writeup and exercise sheets.

### code

Contains the code for this exercise. A few notes about these programs:

* The `.ipynb` files can be run with [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), and contain
the plotting code and analysis code. See the writeup for more details
on what each file contains.

* The `crossval.py` file contains the routine for cross-validation. It does
not have a main method and should not be invoked directly.
